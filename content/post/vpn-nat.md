Hi!
It's going to be my first blog real blog post! I'm going to start from something technical,
quite useful in developers world. From time to time I faced some problems with connecting to my lab,
located in my flat. The situation is because my internet provider uses NAT network. It's not easy
to get access to this network for example over SSH. There are some options, for example team viewer.
Easy for implementation but come one we need something under our own control!
Under Projects category you can find complete tutorial how to install and configure such access option.
